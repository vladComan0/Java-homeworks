/*Write a Java application which contains a class which implements 
the Runnable interface. The class' constructor sets the name of the 
instantiated object. Also, there is a class variable which counts the 
number of instantiated objects from that class. The run( ) method of 
the class will print out the object's name for a number of times equal 
to the counter's value and delayed by 1000 msec. From a separate class, 
create multiple threads build from separate objects of the previously 
described class. Analyze the results.
